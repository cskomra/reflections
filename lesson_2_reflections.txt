What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a file in the directory called .git.  It then used that file to keep track of changes made to other files that are registered as 'tracked' by Git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  What value do you think it offers?

When you add a file to the staging area, you tell Git:  Track changes on this file from this date.
The staging area is an easy way to let Git know this information.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

When done with one logical change, add all files to staging area.  Then commit changes.
